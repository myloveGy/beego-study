## The `db` package

![Upper.io](https://upper.io/db/res/general.png)

`upper.io/db` is a [Go][2] package that allows developers to communicate with
different databases through the use of *adapters* that wrap well-supported
database drivers.

## Is `upper.io/db` an ORM?

`upper.io/db` is not an ORM in the sense that it does not tell you how to
design your software or how to validate your data, instead it only focuses on
being a tool that deals with common operations on different databases:

```go
// This code works the same for all supported databases.
var people []Person

res = col.Find(db.Cond{"name": "Max"}).Limit(10).Sort("-last_name")

err = res.All(&people)
```

In strict sense `upper.io/db` could be considered a really basic non-magical
ORM that rather stays out of the way.

## Supported databases

![Adapters](https://upper.io/db/res/adapters.png)

`upper.io/db` attempts to provide full compatiblity for [CRUD][2] operations
across adapters. Some other operations (such *transactions*) are supported only
on specific database adapters, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.
